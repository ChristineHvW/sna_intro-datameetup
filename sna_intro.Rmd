# Some Basics of Network Analysis    

Network analysis is all about connections (surprise). What sets network analytic approaches apart form 'standard' quantitative research is really the inherent **inter-dependence** of the data. Meaning, observations only exist BECAUSE they are connected. For example, multi-national trade relations require at least two countries to trade goods. Otherwise we can not observe the phenomenon.    

In network terms, each country in the trade example would be called a **node** (or vertex, pl. vertices) and the trade through which the are connected would be an **edge** (or tie). Nodes and edges can have additional features, as we will see below.   

In network analysis, researchers can be interested in the **position of specific nodes** or in the **overall network structure**. There are several quantitative measures you can calculate for this, some of which are introduced below. The network measures can then be both explanatory or dependent variables, depending on your research question.

# Network Analysis in ***R***   

There are several packages for network analysis in R:   

- *igraph* (most popular, syntax rather cryptic, incl. plotting functions)    
- *network* (largely overlaps with igraph, syntax is more straight-forward, part of the 'statnet family')    
- *tidygraph* (builds on igraph and includes most of its functionality, tidy syntax, no plotting functions)    
- *ggraph* (for plotting, syntax like ggplot, mostly used together with tidygraph)   
- *visNetwork*, *threejs*, *networkD3*, *ndtv-d3* (interactive plotting, order ascending in complexity)   

This tutorial will only feature `tidygraph`, `ggraph`, and `visNetwork`. See the *Resources* section for more great material, also for the other packages.   

## Contents of Networks & Basic Graphs    

That networks consist of two types of data (nodes and edges) is also visible in network objects in R. In `tidygraph`, these objects are named `tbl_graph`. Let's construct one of those with some example **node and edge data**.

```{r expl_data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

node_list <- tibble(id = c(1:5))

edge_list <- tibble(from = c(1,1,1,2,3,3,3,4,5,5,5), to = c(2,2,3,4,2,4,5,5,2,2,2)) %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
  summarise(weight = n())

undir_net <- tbl_graph(nodes = node_list, edges = edge_list, directed = FALSE, node_key = "id")
undir_net

```
The minimum content of node data is an identifier variable (here `id`). The identifier has to appear in the edge data as well. There it indicates which nodes are connected to one another (here `from` and `to`). I already added a **weight** to the edges. This is simply a count of how many connections are between a pair of nodes. The resulting graph is **undirected** (`directed = FALSE`), which can be translated as a 'mutual relationship'.   

We can now plot this object with `ggraph`, which basically works like `ggplot2` with some network specific features. The `layout` option defines the algorithm that is responsible for how the nodes and edges are positioned to one another. The layouts available are the same as in the `igraph` function `layout_with_*`. 'kk' stands for Kamada-Kawai, a very common layout algorithm that distributes nodes equally in space.    

```{r ud_uw_na, fig.cap="Undirected, unweighted graph without attributes", echo=TRUE, out.extra='style="width:50%;"'}

pal <- Manu::get_pal("Kereru") # define color palette for plotting (https://github.com/G-Thomson/Manu)

# undirected, unweighted, no attributes  
ggraph(undir_net, layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link() + 
  geom_node_point(size = 10, color = pal[1]) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), 
                 colour = "white", vjust = 0.4) + 
  theme_graph() # theme without axes, gridlines etc.
```

By setting `directed = TRUE` the edges in the graph are now **directed** towards some nodes. Some real-world examples are cash or trade flows, social media communication, or non-mutual friendship ðŸ˜¢    

```{r d_uw_na, fig.cap="Directed, unweighted graph without attributes", echo=TRUE, out.extra='style="width:50%;"'}

dir_net <- tbl_graph(nodes = node_list, edges = edge_list, directed = TRUE, node_key = "id")

ggraph(dir_net, layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(angle = 15, type = "closed", length = unit(4, "mm")), 
                 end_cap = circle(4, "mm")) + # so arrows don't overlap nodes 
  geom_node_point(size = 10, colour = pal[1]) + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), 
                 colour = "white", vjust = 0.4) + 
  theme_graph()
```
We can also visualise the weight of the edges to show how 'strong' certain ties are, using the `width` argument.    

```{r ud_w_na, fig.cap="Undirected, weighted graph without attributes", echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.extra='style="width:50%;"'}

# undirected, weighted, no attributes
ggraph(undir_net, layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), 
                 alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 10, colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), 
                 colour = "white", vjust = 0.4) +
  theme_graph(base_family="sans") # provide font family, otherwise can't render document (Windows)

```
We are often interested in certain **attributes** of nodes or edges. To add some to the example data, `tidygraph` needs to know which data we want to alter (nodes or edges). Therefore, the package contains the `activate` function. Then, we can manipulate data with all the `dplyr` verbs we know and (mostly) love.    

```{r d_uw_a, fig.cap="Undirected, unweighted graph with attributes", echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.extra='style="width:50%;"'}

# undirected, unweighted, with attributes
undir_net.att <- undir_net %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(Preference = rep(c("Python", "R"), c(3, 2))) %>%
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(Relationship = sample(c("Friends", "Foes"), 8, replace = TRUE))

ggraph(undir_net.att, layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(label = Relationship), 
                 angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(2.5, "mm"), label_push = unit(10, "mm"),
                 alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Preference),
                  size = 10) +
  scale_color_manual(values = pal[c(1,2)]) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), 
                 colour = "white", vjust = 0.4) + 
  theme_graph(base_family="sans") # provide font family, otherwise can't render document (Windows)

```
The concept of attributes can be pushed further: we can say that nodes are of different *types*. This results in **bipartite** (or two-mode) networks, where nodes of the same type are not directly connected to one another, but only through the nodes of the other type. This could be employees in firms or authors of research papers, for example.   

```{r bipart, fig.cap = "Bi-partite graph", echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.extra='style="width:50%;"'}

bipart_net <- play_bipartite(8, 2, p=0.8, directed = FALSE) %>% # play_* generates different types of networks
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate("Node.type" = as.character(if_else(type==TRUE, "Firm", "Employee")))

ggraph(bipart_net, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(aes(shape = Node.type , color = Node.type), 
                  size = 6) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = pal[c(1,2)]) +
  theme_graph(base_family="sans") # provide font family, otherwise can't render document (Windows)

```

# Network Data in the Wild: The Matrix Trilogy     

As described above, we need a node and an edge set to do network analysis in R. However, life out there seldom provides us with data in this specific format. This is contrary to, e.g., survey data that is already in a ready-to-use format (apart from some variable recoding etc.).    

```{r netdata_meme, out.width="30%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "data_hard.jpg"))
```

Instead, networks are mostly displayed as different kinds of matrices. How these relate to one another can be confusing and is something we don't usually have to deal with in standard quant research. There are three types of matrices that can be used to describe a network and 'translating' them into the desired format varies by type. Often your data isn't even a matrix yet. In that case, you first have to figure out to which of the following formats you can/should transform it.   

## Adjacency Matrix (aka. Sociomatrix)    

An adjacency matrix is basically a cross-table of the same elements (mostly of the nodes), and is therefore square. The cell values can be restricted to 0/1 to indicate whether there are any connections between the elements, or be a count of the connections.    

```{r adj_mat, echo=TRUE}
adj_mat <- matrix(sample(0:3, 16, replace = TRUE), nrow = 4)

colnames(adj_mat) <- rownames(adj_mat) <- LETTERS[1:4]

adj_mat
```

`tidygraph` can create `tbl_graph` objects from a variety of data formats, also adjacency matrices. 

```{r adj_to_net, echo=TRUE}
adj_to_net <- as_tbl_graph(adj_mat, directed = FALSE)
adj_to_net
```

## Incidence Matrix    

An incidence matrix in contrast, is a cross-table of different elements, e.g. nodes and edges or different types of nodes as in a bipartite graph.   

```{r inc_mat, echo=TRUE}
inc_mat <- matrix(sample(0:3, 12, replace = TRUE), nrow = 3)

rownames(inc_mat) <- LETTERS[1:3]
colnames(inc_mat) <- letters[1:4]

inc_mat
```

Converting the incidence matrix to a network results in this:   

```{r inc_to_net, echo=TRUE}
inc_to_net <- as_tbl_graph(inc_mat, directed = FALSE)
inc_to_net
```

The `type` variable is a logical that denotes the node-type in a bipartite network.   

## Edgelist    

We already know this format and it's just a matrix in disguise. It consists of two columns with labels/names of elements that are connected to one another, and sometimes a weight column. It's actually just the edgelist as in the example network before, yay!    

```{r elist, echo=TRUE}
edge_list
```
```{r elist_to_net, echo=TRUE}
elist_to_net <- as_tbl_graph(edge_list, directed = FALSE)
elist_to_net
```

An edgelist is sufficient to create a network, but often we have some additional data with node attributes like the R and Python users in the example.  

# Real-life Application: Co-authorship Networks   

For a term paper, I downloaded publication lists of the [SOCIUM research centre](https://www.socium.uni-bremen.de/home/en/?). After bringing them into a reasonable format - that is an incidence matrix where authors are connected to publications (bipartite network) - I turned everything into an adjacency matrix connecting authors to one another (this is the only matrix algebra I know). I then added some author attributes like department membership, department position, and gender.   

```{r socpub_data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
soc_inc <- readRDS(here("data", "socpub_bipart.RDS")) # incidence matrix with authors as rows, publications as cols
rownames(soc_inc)[1:3]
colnames(soc_inc)[1:3]
soc_inc[1:3, 1:3]

soc_adj <- soc_inc %*% t(soc_inc) #  inc. matrix x transponse(inc. matrix) = adj. matrix
rownames(soc_adj)[1:3]
colnames(soc_adj)[1:3]
soc_adj[1:3, 1:3]

soc_1mode <- as_tbl_graph(soc_adj, directed = FALSE)
soc_1mode

#soc_2mode <- as_tbl_graph(socpub_inc, directed = FALSE) # this would give the bipartite/two-mode network
#soc_2mode

# read in author attributes and add to graph
auth_att <- as.data.frame(read_excel(here("data", "auth_attributes.xlsx")))
auth_att %<>%
  mutate(socium = if_else(is.na(dep_cat), 0, 1)) %>% # indicator for socium member
  mutate(dep_cat = case_when(dep_cat == 1 ~ "Theory", # label departments
                             dep_cat == 2 ~ "Polit. Economy",
                             dep_cat == 3 ~ "Ineq. in Welfare Societies",
                             dep_cat == 4 ~ "Life Course",
                             dep_cat == 5 ~ "Health")) %>% 
  mutate(al = if_else(socium==1 & is.na(al), 0, al),
         agl = if_else(socium==1 & is.na(agl), 0, agl)) %>% 
  rename("Head Department" = "al", "Head Working Grp." = "agl")
  
soc_attr <- soc_1mode %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  left_join(auth_att)

soc_attr %N>% # shortcut for activate(nodes), %E>% for edges
  as_tibble
```
## Centrality Measures    

Centrality measures can be calculated to identify the "importance" of an actor within a network. As importance can be defined in various ways, there are also different types of centrality (31 of which are built into `tidygraph`). I will introduce only the four most widely used measures here: **degree**, **betweenness**, **eigenvector**, and **closeness** centrality.    

### Degree Centrality   

Degree centrality simply counts the edges attached to a node. In directed networks, you can also specify whether you want to look at the in- or out-degree (edges going to or from a node). In the co-authorship network, the most central actor is the one with the most co-authors (multiple ties are allowed).    

```{r degree, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add cent. measures to nodes 
soc_meas <- 
  soc_attr %N>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(),                       
         betweenness = round(centrality_betweenness(), 2),
         eigen = round(centrality_eigen(), 2),
         closeness = centrality_closeness())

# show name and value of top 10 nodes
soc_meas %N>%              
  arrange(desc(degree)) %>% 
  select(name, degree) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(10)
```

### Betweenness Centrality    

Betweenness centrality counts the shortest paths that go through a node. A path is any series of connected (adjacent) nodes, and it is shorter the fewer nodes have to be passed through. If many shortest paths go through a node, it is an important actor for the transmission efficiency of the network. A node with high betweenness centrality can also be interpreted as a bridging actor, working like a hub through which other nodes are connected.    

```{r betweenness, echo=TRUE}

soc_meas %N>%
  arrange(desc(betweenness)) %>% 
  select(name, betweenness) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(10)
```

### Closeness Centrality    

Closeness Centrality also includes the shortest paths. It is the inverse of the average distance (defined as shortest path) between a node and all other nodes. It basically displays how close a node is to all other nodes.    

```{r closeness, echo=TRUE}

soc_meas %N>%
  arrange(desc(closeness)) %>% 
  select(name, closeness) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(10)
```

If a network is largely disconnected (it is split into multiple **components** or even **isolates**), it doesn't really make sense to calculate closeness centrality because some paths are simply missing. Therefore, I re-define it only for the largest component:   

```{r larg_comp, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

larg_comp <- 
  soc_meas %N>% 
  mutate(component = group_components() %>% 
           factor()) %>%
  group_by(component) %>%
  mutate(comp_size = n()) %>%  
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(comp_size == max(comp_size)) %>% 
  mutate(closeness = centrality_closeness()) 

larg_comp %N>%
  arrange(desc(closeness)) %>% 
  select(name, closeness) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(10)
```

We can see that even the largest values are still pretty small.   

### Eigenvector Centrality    

Eigenvector centrality not only looks at how many ties a node (ego) has, but also how many ties its alters have. High eigenvector centrality means being connected to many other well connected nodes.   

```{r eigenvector, echo=TRUE}

soc_meas %N>%
  arrange(desc(eigen)) %>% 
  select(name, eigen) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(10)
```

## Static Plotting with `ggraph`   

We can now plot the network highlighting the different centrality measures. To increase visibility, the network is reduced to SOCIUM-members.   

```{r soc_plot, echo=TRUE,  out.extra='style="width:auto;"'}
soc_sub <- 
  soc_meas %>%
  filter(socium == 1)

larg_comp_sub <- 
  larg_comp %>% 
  filter(socium == 1)

ggraph(soc_sub, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(dep_cat)), 
                  shape = 21, size = 2) +
  labs(fill = "Department", caption = "Co-authorship network of SOCIUM members.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal)+
  theme_graph(base_family="sans")

ggraph(soc_sub, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = .7) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(dep_cat), size = degree),
                  shape = 21) +
  geom_node_label(aes(filter = degree>quantile(degree, p=.95), label =  name), 
                  vjust = 3, size = 2, alpha = 0.8, label.padding = 0.1, repel = TRUE) +
  labs(fill = "Department", size = "Degree Centrality", 
       caption = "Co-authorship network of SOCIUM members.\nLabelled highest 5% in degree.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal)+
  theme_graph(base_family="sans")

ggraph(soc_sub, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = .7) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(dep_cat), size = betweenness),
                  shape = 21) +  
  geom_node_label(aes(filter = betweenness>quantile(betweenness, p=.95), label =  name), 
                  vjust = 3, size = 2, alpha = 0.8, label.padding = 0.1, repel = TRUE) +
  labs(fill = "Department", size = "Betweenness Centrality", 
       caption = "Co-authorship network of SOCIUM members.\nLabelled highest 5% in betweenness.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal)+
  theme_graph(base_family="sans")

ggraph(larg_comp_sub, layout = "fr") + # plot only largest component for closeness 
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(dep_cat), size = closeness),
                  shape = 21) +
  geom_node_label(aes(filter = closeness>quantile(closeness, p=.95), label =  name), 
                  vjust = 3, size = 2, alpha = 0.8, label.padding = 0.1, repel = TRUE) +
  labs(fill = "Department", size = "Closeness Centrality", 
       caption = "Co-authorship network of SOCIUM members.\nLabelled highest 5% in closeness.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal)+
  theme_graph(base_family="sans")

ggraph(soc_sub, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = .7) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(dep_cat), size = eigen),
                  shape = 21) +
  geom_node_label(aes(filter = eigen>quantile(eigen, p=.99), label =  name), 
                 vjust = 3, size = 2, alpha = 0.8, label.padding = 0.1, repel = TRUE) +
  labs(fill = "Department", size = "Eigenvector Centrality", 
       caption = "Co-authorship network of SOCIUM members.\nLabelled highest 1% in eigenvector.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal)+
  theme_graph(base_family="sans")
```

## Interactive Plotting with `visNetwork`      

Interactive plotting is a great way to explore network data in more detail, especially for larger networks. The `visNetwork` package offers nice customization possibilities, and the result is zoom-, click-, and drag-able. Give it a try!    

One downside is that it the network object has to be split into a node and edge data frame and their variables have to be given specific names, like "id", "label", or "group" if you want to use them for plotting. See [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visNetwork/vignettes/Introduction-to-visNetwork.html) or [here](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) for more documentation.    

```{r visnetwork, echo=TRUE,  out.width="80%"}
node_df <- soc_sub %N>% 
  mutate(id = c(1:240)) %>% 
  rename(label = name, group = dep_cat, size = degree) %>% 
  arrange(as.factor(group)) %>% 
  as.data.frame() 

edge_df <- soc_sub %E>% 
  filter(!edge_is_loop()) %>% # remove loops
  as.data.frame() 

(interact_plot <- 
visNetwork(node_df, edge_df, width = "100%", height = "600px", 
           main = "Interactive plot of SOCIUM co-authorship network",
           footer = "Nodes sized according to degree centrality.") %>% 
  visNodes(shadow = TRUE, font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Theory", color = pal[5]) %>% # have to specify groups individually
  visGroups(groupname = "Polit. Economy", color = pal[4]) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Ineq. in Welfare Societies", color = pal[2]) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Life Course", color = pal[3]) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Health", color = pal[1]) %>% 
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>% 
  visLegend(main="Department", position="right", ncol=1, zoom = FALSE) %>% # can also be manually created
  visOptions(selectedBy = "group"))
```
