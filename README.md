# Intro to (Social) Network Analysis in *R* 
## CorrelAidXBremen Data Meet-up 04/11/2020  

Presentation, code, and data from the meet-up.  

- Focus is on doing network analysis the "tidy" way, using the [tidygraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) and [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph) packages.
- Basic concepts and measures of network analysis are introduced.
- A scientific co-authorship network serves as example data (complete data set [here](https://github.com/christine-hvw/coauthr_net-socium)).
